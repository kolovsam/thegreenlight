        <h1>What is The Green Light?</h1>
        <p>
            The Green Light is a third space for both work and play where folks can 
            find and build community in the Seattle area. Until we have a space to call home, 
            you can join co-working and board game events around the city!
        </p>
        <p>
            The vision for the space is a college common room for adults that offers flexible 
            workspaces, meeting areas, and evening events like game nights and silent reading, 
            all fueled by comfort food, snacks, and a strong sense of belonging.

        <h1>Sam Kolovson</h1>
        <p>
            What's up? I'm Sam (she/they), founder of The Green Light. Whenever you meet someone new in 
            Seattle the first three things you need to know about them are how long they have been here,
            where they are from (if not here, which is likely) and if they are a cat or dog person. So, 
            I've been in Seattle almost 10 years, I am from Massachusetts, and I have a seven year old 
            cat that I probably should have named something other than Luna. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Those three things might tell you a bit about me, but not why I started The Green Light.
            I am passionate about connecting and bringing people together, espcially the queer community and the city of Seattle. 
            My hope is that The Green Light is a place where all kinds of connections can thrive and 
            there is always a place to sit or something to take part in.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to know more about me, I'd love to chat with you at at upcoming event, feel free to reach
            out through email or social media, or you can always <a href="http://www.kolovsam.com" style="color:#E4D7C4">look here</a>.
