        <h1>What is The Green Light?</h1>
        <p>
            The Green Light is a third space for both work and play where folks can 
            find and build community in the Seattle area. Until we have a space to call home, 
            you can join co-working and board game events around the city!
        </p>
        <p>
            The vision for the space is a college common room for adults that offers flexible 
            workspaces, meeting areas, and evening events like game nights and silent reading, 
            all fueled by comfort food, snacks, and a strong sense of belonging.
